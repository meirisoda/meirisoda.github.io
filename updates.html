                                <br>Switched back from <a href="https://meirisoda.neocities.org"><u>https://meirisoda.neocities.org</u></a> to github. I plan on writing a blog post on why and my feelings towards both websites sometimes soon - once I figure out the html for my blog page. I know it was a short time on my neocities site... but I'm back... unfortunately.</p>
                        <b>07/17/2022 0240</b>
                        <br><mark><b>***IMPORTANT***</b></mark>
                        <br>I'm moving back to Github - but not for the reason you would think.
                        <br><mark>visit my new homepage at <a href="https://meirisoda.github.io">https://meirisoda.github.io</a>.</mark>
                        <br>I initially started my website on github, but I felt that my creativity and freedom(?) was being stifled on github so I scrapped this website and created a new website from scratch using neocities. But as much as I love neocities and the freedom I felt from it, I am not a very efficient or proficient coder. I make a lot of mistakes and make a lot of changes that require me to make large changes to many many different html files (I know I can probably link my stylesheet better but I haven't figured that out yet...). The way I code is far too rudimentary for me to continue coding on neocities without a code client (like VSC).  So I'm moving back to github! My original github website can be found @ <a href="https://github.com/meirisoda/meirisoda.github.io/releases/tag/archive">https://github.com/meirisoda/meirisoda.github.io/releases/tag/archive</a> (just download it and you can navigate from there) and this site will still be up, but I will not be updating here anymore. Thank you for staying for the short short time I was here. I really enjoy neocities, but again, I'm a horrible coder and its SO MUCH WORK for me to copy and paste the same thing across so many different pages every single time I want to update something. (Again, I'm not very efficient....)</p>
                        <b>07/17/2022 0148</b>
                                <br>All updates I was working on for <a href="https://meirisoda.github.io/inspiration.html"><u>好きのもの</u>></a> is now done! (Well, not entirely, because I still haven't workedon the page for writings... but its ok). I made it look more like a file explorer, so it will be easier for people to navigate. Right now the content for each page is still pretty basic, but I plan on writing little blurbs on each page!</p>
                        <b>07/16/2022 2118</b>
                                <br>Major major changes underway! specifically pertaining to <a href="https://meirisoda.github.io/inspiration.html"><u>好きのもの</u></a>.</p>
                        <b>07/16/2022 1710</b>
                                <br>Big style changes - changed the padding on the right, added a few different gifs here and there, and also updated the <a href="https://meirisoda.github.io/pictures.html"><u>pictures</u></a> section with a new navigation tab on the left! Fixed some of the zoom scaling in sketchbook and illustrations. All of this is still in progress, but a lot is being updated and changed!</p>
                        <b>07/15/2022 1616</b>
                                <br>Since figuring out how to add scroll bars and to fix heights on tables, I have gone around and added that same feature(?) to all applicable pages on the site :3</p>
                        <p><b>07/15/2022 1530</b>
                                <br>I finally added a site updates section! I have also figured out how to enlarge images upon hover, so now you all can actually see my illustrations at a bigger scale.</p>
                        <p><b>07/14/2022</b>
                                <br>Drew a better header image for the site and updated my avatar(?) in <a href="https://meirisoda.github.io/about.html"><u>about</u></a>. I think I know what direction I want to take my website in now.</p>
                        <p><b>07/12/2022</b>
                                <br>Added a new illustration to <a href="https://meirisoda.github.io/visual.html"><u>illustrations</u></a>!</p>
                        <p><b>07/06/2022</b>
                                <br>Moved from <a href="https://meirisoda.github.io"><u>my github pages</u></a> to neocities.org! I think I wanted to be in an environment with more freedom and amateurs rather than a super CS-saturated environment. I quite literally started learning html/css/js starting in May 28 and although I was super proud of myself, I still felt so out of place.</p>
