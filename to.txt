To Sarah
You are alright here, you are accepted. We love you and we will embrace you from the depths of your mind, your pain, your happiness, we will embrace all worry, all doubt, all the struggles and things that you say to yourself, and I will still love you. You are who you are, and we will love you in your entirety. Everything 'good', everything 'bad' and everything in between is all part of who you are, and nothing will take that away from you. You are your mind, you are your soul, your lost sense of self is the path to awareness. It takes time but you must understand that I am still watching over you even through the struggles and journey you are so trudgingly sad about. I am always here for you, I love you, I will embrace you, you are worthy. You are worthy of my love not because of what you have done or the achievements that you've made but because you are here. You are here and alive, and that is all that was needed for me to love you. There is no need for searching, for a painful trip to the end and back, you are existing. you are physical. you are positioned, in this place, at this time, real or not, you are still here and aware. You are still existing in my mind and for that I love you. Keep breathing and ground yourself. You are here. And I love you.
