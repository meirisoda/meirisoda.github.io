                  Another entry in which I can sit down and thought dump! I've been working on a new drawing - basically spent hours drawing and meticulously rendering with pencil only for me to render over everything with a circle brush... I wanted to draw and color in a softer style (ririfa浮-esque) but it wasn't working out so I am basically redrawing and re-rendering my entire drawing. On the flipside, I am very happy with how it's looking now (though for some reason the pencilwork version looks like she is tilted to her left but in the circle brush rendered version she is facing completely forward? I need to decide if I'm going to keep keep her looking centered or shade so she's looking to her left...orz)
                <br>
                <br>I was also going to draw a full Matsuri Hino-style background but I gave up (which you'll be able to see once I finish the drawing and upload the speedpaint on youtube). Instead I added some illustrative motifs such as the emblem and ribbon (and the frame!), which kind of feels like a cop-out... (→_→) but I'm still happy with how it looks so that's all that matters.

                  <br>
                  <div class="text">
                    Overall I'm very pleased with how everything is looking so far so it's just a matter of sitting down and rendering. 
                    <br>
                    <br>Speaking of, I also think it's the first time I've actually discussed my art influences for a drawing I'm working on. I usually avoid doing so and I wrote about it previously in <a href="https://meirisoda.github.io/thoughts.html">my journal</a> (titled 2022-05-27 (3)). Adding onto that, I also avoid sharing what artists that I like because I get influenced and inspired by these artists, so inevitably those influenes will be seen in my art. There were a couple times (around 3 years ago) when people have commented that my artwork reminds them of this person or that person, and that really fueled my insecurity. I felt that if people look at my art and get reminded of some other artist, my identity as an artist is that much more invalid. Hence, I didn't want to share what artists that I liked in fear of losing myself. 
                      <br>
                      <br>That's kind of changing nowadays as I find myself being more comfortable sharing who I'm being influenced by. My relationship with art has definitely improved a lot since then and the feeling of dread whenever I think about drawing disappears every day. In my previous entry here I wrote that I've "been spending the last couple weeks just re-learning to like what i like... i always feel like i need to fit into a certain mold or have a cohesive aesthetic - which is nice, but humans aren't one-dimensional creatures. that's why i keep overhauling my website and making large changes, but i'm learning to be okay with that. it's not that i'm rebranding myself or becoming a new person every couple days. i still like what i like and those things haven't changed since middle  school. it's just a matter of learning to express those in a healthy way that i feel comfortable and proud in."
                      <br>
                      <br>And that's basically what I've been doing! I've been revisiting my old childhood favorite shoujo mangas and mangakas and it's reminding me of the things that make me truly happy and the art that inspired me to draw in the first place as a child.
                      <br>
                      <br>In order:
                      <br>Shugo Chara (Peach-Pit); Tanemura Arina; Matsuri Hino; Sugar Sugar Rune (Moyoco Anno); CLAMP; Yume Kira Dream Shoppe (Aqua Mizuto)

                      <br>
                      <br>I had forgotten how much Tanemura-sensei influenced me as a child. So in the name of nostalgia and re-living my childhood, I rewatched all of Sugar Sugar Rune recently. I was planning on rewatching Shugo Chara as well, but I want to rewatch it in Korean (which is how I consumed Shugo Chara content as a child), so I'm rewatching K-on! instead. Hopefully I'll be able to find a good streaming site (☆ω☆).

                  <br>I've been having pretty intense art block. Honestly, it probably has to do with the fact I'm working out my interests and methods of expression (as mentioned above). Since i've been mostly working, I don't spend time outside much - so when I do go outside, I've been dressing up! I feel so cute when I dress the way I want to	( ´ ▽ ` ).｡ｏ

                  Just thought that I could now take this time to use this section of my site for what it was intended for, which was to share the things that I'm liking at the moment! I've been rereading Nana (for like the 7th time, the last time I reread it was about 2 years ago?). I recently broke my favorite glass cup so I purchased a strawberry cup to replace it! I only got one for myself instead of a pair (╯_╰)
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  I also found some cute shirts and skirts on depop that I would like to purchase sometime! I am now almost exclusively shopping second-hand (except for things like undergarments and socks). There is also this nice floral blouse that my mom was going to give me years ago, so when I go home in the holidays I might pick it up :3
                  <br><br>
                  <br>Here are some things I want to purchase (some I can only dream of buying, so expensive!!):

                my laptop is broken! i've been trying to get it repaired but dell's customer service has been difficult to work with. hence why i haven't updated my website since October 13th (most of it is because i've been lazy (シ. .)シ). Anyways, I'm currently using a public computer to update and hopefully nothing goes wrong. 
                <br>Life has been pretty hectic and there are so many things I want to share but since I am unable to do a lot for my site at the moment I'll just share a new drawing that I finished a couple weeks ago!

                    I'm very proud of this one and I'm glad that I was able to get back into colour. I tried playing around with more saturated colours (saturated for what I usually draw) and I'm very pleased with the outcome! 
                    This is it for now and hopefully I can get my laptop fixed soon!

                i'm going to use this page to place things i've done/like that i feel represents me the most at the moment of posting. also going to share things that i've found or want to share! i downloaded procreate recently and it took me a couple tries to get used to the workflow (as i moved from Clip Studio Paint). i'm actually quite proud of this drawing and i hope you guys like it too.
