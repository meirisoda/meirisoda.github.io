I started learning html/css/js in May, and originally created a github pages website. 
However, I felt that my creativity and freedom(?) was being stifled so I scrapped this website and created a new website from scratch using neocities (meirisoda.neocities.org).
But as much as I love neocities and the freedom I felt from it, I am not a very efficient or proficient coder. I make a lot of mistakes and make a lot of changes that require me to make large changes to many many different html files (I know I can probably link my stylesheet better but I haven't figured that out yet...). The way I code is far too rudimentary for me to continue coding on neocities without a code client (like VSC). 

So I'm moving back to github! My original github website can be found @ https://github.com/meirisoda/meirisoda.github.io/releases/tag/archive (just download it and you can navigate from there) and my neocities website https://meirisoda.neocities.org is still going to be up, but I will not be updating on there anymore. 


Thank you!
