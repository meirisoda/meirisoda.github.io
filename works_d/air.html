<b>about... air (Procreate,2022)</b>

this was my first proper animation i've ever done.
i took a lot of inspiration from <a href="https://twitter.com/ph4_18c">ph4_18c</a> for this one. i've been a huge fan of their
works for a while now and i've wanted to draw on top of photographs. i never got
around to doing it because i thought that whatever i'd draw on top would look out
of place and unnecessary.
i found this picture on pinterest (original included an interior of an apartment)
and eventually i've found that i only really liked the window.

the outcome didn't come out as i wished it would as the creature doesn't look like it's
moving along the air as it is static. however, when i make more animations in the future
i'll take note of that and figure something out.
